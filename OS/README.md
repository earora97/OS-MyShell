README

The folder consists of C files, a header file and a Makefile.

On applying 'make' command, all the files get executed and the executable myshell can be run by applying command './myshell'.

The shell opens up thereafter.

All the required and bonus features have been implemented.

The shell supports all builtin commands and commands like cd, pwd, echo have been implemented separately.

Also all other commands like ls, ps (along with flags) work.
